 <h2 class = "postTitle">Here's why you might want to quit carbs</h2>
 
 <p class = "dateAuthor"><italic>September 29, 2021 by Jason DeCambre</italic></h3>
 <img id = "float1" src = "food.jpg" alt = "Picture of healthy food"/>
 <p>Carbohydrates have long been proposed to be what should make up the majority 
    of our diets. But did you know that the traditional food pyramid was <strong>NOT</strong>
    made by the US Departnment of Health? That's right -- it was made by the US Department
    of <strong>AGRICULTURE.</strong> Let that sink in. The USDA has long advocated for subsidies
    for cheap foodstuffs, which tend to be carbohydrates. This is supposed to help many disadvantaged
    persons and farmers. But why might this be a problem?</p>

<p>The human body uses sugars (a form of carbohydrate) for energy. Without enough sugars, your body starts 
    to burn fat for energy. Ever wanted to lose weight? Now you know to cut down on carbs. Also, 90% of your serotonin
    is produced by your gut bacteria -- and if the bacteria that feeds on carbs out-competes the serotonin-producing
    bacteria then you get moody and irritable all the time. Not to mention your blood sugar fluctuates way more on
    a high-carb diet. So maybe you'd want to try going without carbs for a month. You could just attain your dream body!</p>

    <h2 class = "postTitle">COVID and authoritarianism</h2>
    <p class = "dateAuthor"><italic>September 29, 2021 by Jason DeCambre</italic></h3>
    <img id = "float2" src = "covid.jpg" alt = "Picture of a cell inside a human body with COVID spikes"/>
    <p>Have you ever wondered why many persons around the world seem so willing to give up their freedoms to comply with 
        lockdowns that are allegedly to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus? Have you wondered why there are also so 
        many "anti-vaxxers", "anti-maskers" or other persons who seem to be on the other side of the spectrum? The parasite 
        stress hypothesis (PSH) offers some insight to that. </p>
   
    <p>The PSH proposes that the greater a locale's vulnerability to infectious diseases, the greater the prevalence of 
        authoritarian attitudes on the individual level and therefore the greater likelihood of the prevailing government 
        to be authoritarian. The correlation between infection vulnerability and authoritarianism is greater than that between
        IQ and grades! So why the dissenting sides? Some political leaders support "containment measures", and others are 
        against them. Many follow either of the 2 authorities without considering the research for themselves or being wary
        of misinformation, which reflects an individual authoritarian attitude in any case. So let's keep ourselves informed 
        and stay rational. Biology is not on our side in this case.</p>
